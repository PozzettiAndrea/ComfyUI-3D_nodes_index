2 positives becouse in pony models I always want to keep the scores separate from the prompt.
2 positive text are concatenated and send over as one conditional.

## Features
- **2 positive text encoders**: Users can use one for scores while other to change the prompt as they want.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Easy to use within the ComfyUI environment.

## Usage
1. Open ComfyUI.
2. Add the custom node from the node library.
3. Insert the prompts.

5. Conect outputs to the Sampler.

# 5. Upscale Latent/Image by 1.5

## Overview
I created this node for my workflows in which I'm using 16:9 resolution, and 
from (1280x720) 16x9, it's exactly 1.5 times smaller than (1080x1920) 16x9

That's why I made it :D

## Features
- upscale latent by 1.5 for the next Hi-Rez
- amount to duplicate IMG n times so you can choose the one you like 

## Usage
1. Open ComfyUI.
2. Add the custom node from the node library.
3. Insert the latent image.
4. Select the amount you want, default is 1.
5. Connect output to the Sampler.
