## 🛠️ The Utilities

### 1. Split Screen View

**Dual viewports for large workflows.** *(**NOT!!** Nodes 2.0 compatible)*

Adds a "Split Screen" toggle to the main toolbar, allowing you to view two independent areas of the same workflow simultaneously.

* **Independent Navigation:** Zoom in on a control group in the Left Pane while watching the results in the Right Pane.
* **Shared Graph:** Moving a node in one view moves it in the other.
* **State Saving:** Remembers your split position and camera coordinates in the workflow metadata.
* *(Experimental)* Toggle interaction on/off for the secondary view.

### 2. Catch & Edit Text

**Manual control for generated prompts.** *(Nodes 2.0 compatible)*

Often, AI-generated prompts (e.g., from dynamic prompt nodes) are *almost* perfect but need a human touch. A little change of words, removing some nonsense, etc. Or maybe you now want a *blue* car instead of a *red* one. You don't need an completely new generated prompt for that, costing valuable resources and possibly rated API calls. 
This `Catch & Edit Text` node shows text being created by a previous node and enables editing the text for subsequent runs.

* **Edit & Continue:** After the initial run, tweak the text in the box, and continue processing.
* **Save Resources:** When editing, the node can mute the previous generator to prevent wasted API calls or regeneration.
* **Visual Clarity:** toggle to show selected mode on node header.(Green=Pass input, Yellow=Soft Mute, Red=Hard Block)

**Modes (`action` switch):**

* **`Use_input`**: Passes the incoming text through unchanged. (overwrites Editblock with newly generated content, ready to edit)
* **`Use_edit_mute_Input`**: Uses your edited text and **soft mutes** the input node (saving resources).
* **`Use_edit_BLOCK_inputnode`**: Uses your edited text and **hard blocks** the input node (prevents execution even if upstream seeds change).

---

### 3. Preview Image (No Save)

**A true disposable preview.** *(Nodes 2.0 compatible)*

Standard "Preview Image" nodes save files to your `ComfyUI\temp` directory, which persists until the server restarts. This node sends the image directly to your browser memory without writing to the disk.

* **Zero Clutter:** On page reload, the image is gone.
* **Privacy:** No residual files left on the server.
* **Flexible:** Supports resizing options, RGBA images, and masks.

---

### 4. Preview Image (Ad-Hoc Save)

**Preview now, save later.** *(Nodes 2.0 compatible)*

Behaves like the "No Save" node by default (images are disposable), but gives you the option to save specific successful generations without re-running the workflow.

* **Manual Save:** Click the button to save the current image immediately.
* **Auto-Save Toggle:** Switch `autosave` to true to capture the next run automatically.
* **Filename Sync:** Supports `filename_main` and `counter` inputs to keep multiple Ad-Hoc save nodes (e.g., Original vs. Upscaled) in sync with the same index number.

---

### 5. Preview Compare Lastgen

**Compare your image against last run.** *(Nodes 2.0 compatible)*

Partly a clone of Ad-hoc Save, but has comparison tools built in. Regular A/B compare already exists as nodes; this one compares against previous generated image. 

* **Preview Ad-hoc Plus:** Same features, and more.
* **Compare against last Gen:** Easy slider to compare with reference and see the differences with new seed or new prompt.
* **Blink and workflow info:** Quick blink the reference for 'at a glance' comparison. Check the workflow info for changes in the workflow.

### 6. Node Matcher ("U Might Have A Node For That")

**Stop installing duplicate node packs.** *(Nodes 2.0 compatible)*

When loading workflows from CivitAI or Reddit, you often see missing nodes. This utility helps you find equivalent nodes you **already have installed** based on inputs, outputs, and functionality.

* **Usage:** Right-click any node (missing or existing) to see a ranked list of alternatives.
* **Smart Matching:** Matches based on Name, S&R Name, Inputs, and Outputs.
* **Core Awareness:** Identifies standard ComfyUI nodes as `*(Core)` to help you reduce dependencies.
* **Settings:** Tweak search sensitivity in `ComfyUI Settings > IMGNR`.

| Right-Click Menu | Ranked Results |
| :---: | :---: |
| ![Menu](img/UMightHaveANodeForThat_1.png) | ![Results](img/UMightHaveANodeForThat_2.png) |

> ***NOTE:*** As not all nodes have clear descriptions and input/output, the matching is based on 'name', 'S&R name', 'inputs' and 'outputs'. It could therefor also rank nodes that are actually different. But it could also rank nodes that don't *seem* to match, but actually *do*.

---

### 7. DIY-Nodes (Previously Txt2Combo nodes)

**Build your own dynamic nodes** *(Nodes 2.0 compatible)*

Create your own nodes using simple text files. This is ideal for prompt styles, camera models, or frequently used settings.
You can use comboboxes, `STRING`, `TEXTBOX`, `INT`, `FLOAT` and even `concat` different combinations, all in one node, tailored to your needs.

* **Create:** Use the `DIY Node Writer` node (or edit files in `User/IMGNR-Utils/DIY-nodes`) to create and maintain your custom combonodes.
* **Connect:** Link your DIY node outputs to be the input for any node.
* **Use:** Fill in the fields, or Select your value from the dropdown.
![DIY Usecase](img/Txt2Combo_Usecase.gif)

**Advanced Features:**

* **Multi-Combo:** Use brackets `[Section Name]` in your text file to create one node with multiple dropdowns and outputs.
* **Inspect:** Connect the Writer `inspect`-output to an existing combo input on *any* node to import its values into the editor box to then cherrypick and make your custom list.[^1]

* **Build your own path:** By combining comboboxes and inputfields you can create your own path for example for consistent file saving.
![DIY Usecase](img/DIY-nodes-savedirs.png)

> ***NOTE:***
>
> - *Editing items inside existing sections only requires a Refresh (R).*
> - *Adding new files (Nodes) or `[Sections]` requires a Server Restart to update the nodes. (`filename` --> Node Name: `DIY: Filename`)*
> - More examples in the examples folder [DIY-node-library](./DIY-node-library/) or in the Example Workflows in ComfyUI
> - Will try to find missing DIY nodes in the node-library; feel free to submit your own by adding an Issue here.

### 8. ABBA Switch

**Switch AB to BA** *(Nodes 2.0 compatible)*

Not much to it.... just swap any 2 inputs

* **SWAP** Swap ANY 2 inputs (must be same type)
* **Why** Quickly switch Width/Height, Positive/Negative, etc.
* **Toggle** Toggle the Swap on or off.
