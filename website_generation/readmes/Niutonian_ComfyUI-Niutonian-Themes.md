## Usage

### Per-Node Themes (NEW!)
Apply different themes to individual nodes for better visual organization:

**Setting a Node Theme:**
1. Right-click on any node
2. Select **"🎨 Node Theme"** from the context menu
3. Choose a theme to apply to just that node
4. The node will use its own theme while other nodes use the global theme

**Reverting to Global Theme:**
1. Right-click on the node
2. Select **"🎨 Node Theme"** → **"🌐 Use Global Theme"**
3. The node will return to using the global theme

**Features:**
- Each node can have its own independent theme
- Per-node themes are **saved with your workflow** - they persist when you save and reload
- Mix and match themes to visually organize your workflow (e.g., use Ocean Deep for input nodes, Ember Glow for processing nodes)
- The menu shows which theme is currently applied with a ✓ checkmark
- Per-node themes work alongside the global theme system

**Use Cases:**
- **Visual Organization**: Use different themes for different stages of your workflow (input, processing, output)
- **Highlight Important Nodes**: Make critical nodes stand out with a distinct theme
- **Color Coding**: Group related nodes with the same theme for easier navigation
- **Workflow Clarity**: Use contrasting themes to separate different processing chains

### Disabling the Theme
Want to revert to the original ComfyUI appearance? You have multiple options:

**Method 1: Menu (Easiest)**
1. Right-click on the canvas
2. Select **Niutonian Theme** → **"⏸️ Disable Theme"**
3. The theme will be completely disabled, showing original ComfyUI styling

**Method 2: Keyboard Shortcut (Fastest)**
- Press **Alt + ` (backtick)** to instantly disable the theme
- The backtick key is usually above Tab, left of the number 1

When disabled, all custom rendering is bypassed and ComfyUI displays with its original default appearance. Your choice is automatically saved and persists across sessions.

### Switching Themes
1. Right-click on the canvas to open the context menu
2. Select **Niutonian Theme**
3. Choose your preferred theme from the submenu

Or use keyboard shortcuts:
- **Alt + ` (backtick)**: Disable theme (original ComfyUI)
- **Alt+1** through **Alt+9**: Select themes 1-9
- **Alt+0**: Select theme 10 (Ember Glow)

### Manual Node Coloring
You can override theme colors for individual nodes:
1. Right-click on any node
2. Select a color from the color palette
3. The node will use your custom color instead of the theme color
4. To remove manual coloring, select the default color or clear the color setting

**Note**: Manually colored nodes will not display theme effects (glass, glow, scanlines) but will still show execution glow when running.

**Difference between Manual Colors and Per-Node Themes:**
- **Manual Colors**: Simple color override, no theme effects, set via the Colors menu
- **Per-Node Themes**: Full theme with all effects (glass, glow, shadows, etc.), set via the Node Theme menu

### Node State Colors
The theme system automatically applies different colors based on node states:

**Styling Priority (highest to lowest):**
1. **Manual Colors** - Colors set via right-click → Colors menu (overrides everything)
2. **Executing Nodes** - Bright glow with execution color when running
3. **Error Nodes** - Red/orange tones when nodes have errors (`has_errors: true`)
4. **Bypassed Nodes** - Muted gray tones when nodes are bypassed
5. **Per-Node Theme** - Custom theme set via right-click → Node Theme menu
6. **Global Theme** - The theme selected from the canvas menu

**Bypassed Nodes:**
- Nodes set to bypass mode (right-click → Bypass) display in muted colors
- Each theme has a custom bypass color that maintains visual hierarchy
- Bypassed nodes are easily identifiable while preserving the theme aesthetic

**Error Nodes:**
- Nodes with validation errors or runtime issues display in error colors
- Each theme includes appropriate red/orange error colors
- Error state takes priority over bypass state for immediate problem identification

**Per-Node Themes:**
- Apply different themes to individual nodes via right-click → Node Theme
- Per-node themes are saved with your workflow
- Great for visual organization and workflow clarity
