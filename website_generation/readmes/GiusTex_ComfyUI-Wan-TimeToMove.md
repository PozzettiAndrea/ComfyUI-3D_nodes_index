### Updates:
- Solved color issue.
- Fixed other bugs.

### Nodes
The custom node contains 4 new nodes:
- `Encode WanVideo`: taken from wanvideo-wrapper, it encodes the reference video.
- `TTM Latent Add`: taken from wanvideo-wrapper, it embeds in the latent the reference to the driving video.
- `Timove To Move Guider`: this node adds the ttm latent to the latent noise before passing it to the sampling function. This node removes the necessity of a dedicated sampler.
- `CFG Float List Scheduler`: taken from wanvideo-wrapper, it creates a list of cfg values, and submits them step by step, making possible using different cfg values at different steps.

### Other custom nodes used:
- The advanced sampler used in the [second workflow](https://github.com/GiusTex/ComfyUI-Wan-TimeToMove/blob/TTM-v2/wanvideo_2_2_I2V_A14B_TimeToMove_workflow2.json) can be found [here](https://github.com/GiusTex/ComfyUI-MoreEfficientSamplers). You can still use the native comfyui `sampler custom advanced` using [this](https://github.com/GiusTex/ComfyUI-Wan-TimeToMove/blob/TTM-v2/wanvideo_2_2_I2V_A14B_TimeToMove_workflow1.json) workflow.
- The scheduler used is [this](https://github.com/BigStationW/flowmatch_scheduler-comfyui), useful for models using lightx loras. You can still use other samplers/schedulers.
