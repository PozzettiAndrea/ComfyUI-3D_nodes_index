3. Select the task type (depth or normal)
4. Adjust the parameters as needed
5. Run the workflow

### Parameters

#### Relighting Node

| Parameter | Description | Default | Range |
| --------- | ----------- | ------- | ----- |
| **Model** | The LBM model file to use | `LBM_relighting.safetensors` | - |
| **Steps** | Number of inference steps | 28 | 1-100 |
| **Precision** | Inference precision | bf16 | fp32, bf16, fp16 |
| **Bridge Noise Sigma** | Controls diversity of results | 0.005 | 0.0-0.1 |

#### Depth/Normal Node

| Parameter | Description | Default | Range |
| --------- | ----------- | ------- | ----- |
| **Task** | Select task type | depth | depth, normal |
| **Steps** | Number of inference steps | 28 | 1-100 |
| **Precision** | Inference precision | bf16 | fp32, bf16, fp16 |
| **Bridge Noise Sigma** | Controls diversity of results | 0.1 | 0.0-0.1 |
| **Mask** | Optional mask for selective processing | None | - |

## Setting Tips

| Setting | Recommendation |
| ------- | -------------- |
| **Steps** | For most images, 20-30 steps provides a good balance between quality and speed |
| **Input Resolution** | The model works best with images of 512x512 or higher resolution |
| **Memory Usage** | If you encounter memory issues, try using fp16 precision or processing images at a lower resolution |
| **Performance** | For batch processing, consider reducing steps to 15-20 for faster throughput |
| **Bridge Noise Sigma** | Lower values (0.005) for relighting, higher values (0.1) for depth/normal maps |

## About Model

This implementation uses the Latent Bridge Matching (LBM) method from the paper "LBM: Latent Bridge Matching for Fast Image-to-Image Translation". The model is designed for fast image relighting, transforming the lighting of objects in an image.

LBM offers:
* Fast processing with a single inference step
* High-quality relighting effects
* Memory-efficient operation
* Consistent results across various image types
* Support for depth and normal map generation
* Mask-based selective processing

The model is trained on a diverse dataset of images with different lighting conditions, ensuring:
* Balanced representation across different image types
* High accuracy in various scenarios
* Robust performance with complex lighting

## Roadmap

Future plans for this repository include:
* LBM Depth - for depth map estimation
* LBM Normal - for normal map generation
* Additional optimization options
