ComfyUI nodes for interactive image manipulation and flexible file looping. Provides four specialized nodes for cropping, pasting, looping and saving IMAGE, LATENT, AUDIO and STRING file types, with preview capabilities for images and masks.

ComfyUI-Loop is essentially a pair of nodes designed to create a simple file loop within your workflows. The operating principle is straightforward: the Save Any node saves an image by overwriting the file specified in the 'path' field, making it automatically available for the next iteration. This functionality is primarily intended for inpainting workflows.

### COMFYUI-LOOP NODES ARE NOT COMPATIBLE WITH NODES 2.0 (and almost certainly never will be, for all the good reasons discussed elsewhere). ###

All nodes tested, working with ComfyUI from 0.3.64 to 0.8.2, and ComfyUI_Frontend from v1.27.10 to v1.36.13

## 0.2 version - last changes 10/23/2025 :
Better integration with last ComfyUI version. Better code structure.
- Now there's only four nodes for two main usages, looping files and visual cutting-pasting:
  
  **[Loop Any] -> [Save Any]**
  
  loop any file type : image (png), mask (png), latent (image/audio/whatever), audio (flac), string (or int/float) saved as text file.

  **[Image Crop] -> [Paste Image]**
  
  ImageCrop works with last Comfy frontend (excepting Nodes 2.0, of course :) )

TL;DR : Revisited code from A to Z. Crop your images and masks, loop your files, the fun way.

## ♾️ Image Crop
Interactive image cropping with live preview. Define a tile size for your crop and drag/drop on an image preview. Also supports direct widget input and some keyboard controls (PageUp/Down to resize).
The preview represents a downscaled version of the current image input, while the preview mask is a downscaled binary version of the input mask. If the inputs haven’t changed significantly from the previously loaded files, the previews will remain unchanged (improving the execution speed of your workflow).

**Inputs:**
| Parameter | Type | Default | Range | Description |
|-----------|------|---------|-------|-------------|
| `image` | IMAGE | - | - | Source image to crop |
| `x` | INT | 0 | 0-32768 | X-origin of crop rectangle |
| `y` | INT | 0 | 0-32768 | Y-origin of crop rectangle |
| `size` | INT | 512 | 256-2048 | Crop size (increments of 8) |
| `color` | LIST | "black" | ["black","grey","red","green","blue"] | Preview rectangle color |
| `show_mask` | boolean | True | - | show binary mask preview |
| `mask` | MASK | - | - | Optional mask |

**Outputs:**
- `source`: Original image
- `cut`: Cropped image
- `size`: crop size used
- `x`: X-position used
- `y`: Y-position used
- `cut_mask`: Cropped mask

---

## ♾️ Paste Image
Pastes cropped images onto source images with optional masking/blending.

**Inputs:**
| Parameter | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `source` | Base image to paste onto |
| `cut` | Image segment to paste |
| `x` | X-position for pasting |
| `y` | Y-position for pasting |
| `cut_mask` | Optional mask for blending |

**Outputs:**
- `image`: final image

## ♾️ Loop Any
Loops various file types (images, masks, latents, audio, text) from ComfyUI's output directory or one of its subfolders  basically by loading and overwriting the file specified in the 'path' field, making it automatically available for the next iteration.

**Inputs:**
| Parameter | Type | Default | Description |
|-----------|------|---------|-------------|
| `input` | ANY | - | Input data to process/loop |
| `loop_file` | BOOL | False | Enable file looping mode |
| `filename` | STRING | "loop_file" | Base filename (no extension) |
| `subfolder` | STRING | "" | Output subdirectory |
| `loop_mask` | BOOL | False | Enable mask looping ( load mask from loop image alpha channel instead of mask input|
| `mask` | MASK | - | Optional input mask (conditional : image input)|

**Outputs:**
- `output`: Processed output data
- `path`: Full file path
- `width`: Output width (conditional : image/mask/latent input)
- `height`: Output height (conditional : image/mask/latent input)
- `mask`: optional mask to send to Save Any node, for saving as alpha channel (conditional : image input)

---

## ♾️ Save Any
Saves various data types to 'path' directory with optional versioned backups and optional preview.

**Inputs:**
| Parameter | Type | Default | Description |
|-----------|------|---------|-------------|
| `input` | ANY | - | Data to save |
| `path` | STRING | "/path/to/file.ext" | Full output path |
| `save_steps` | BOOL | False | Save timestamped copies |
| `mask` | MASK | - | Optional mask (for images) |

**Saving Formats:**
- Images: `.png`
- Masks: `.png`
- Latents: `.latent`
- Audio: `.flac`
- Text: `.txt`

## Install
No additional dependencies are required. Search for 'Loop' in the ComfyUI Custom Nodes Manager or copy the ComfyUI-Loop folder into the Custom Nodes directory — and you're ready to go!

## Usage
Have a look at the workflow (json or .png) in /example_workflow and the one-minute video, for up to date informations on usage and working example.
**Always** work on a copy of your source file (if you don't want it to be overwritten).

## Limitations
- No support for lists or batch inputs.
- Not as user friendly as I want it to be out of the box (some small lacks in code to fix later.)

## Future plans
- adding some kind of mask edit capabilities in the 'Image Crop' node
- more file format outputs
- your suggestions, as always welcome
- Better code, without changing the developer ha ha prey for a miracle!

I plan to revisit the code later but it works well for basic use (don't judge a fish by its ability to climb a tree, I do my best :D). 
If you encounter issues or have suggestions, ask on the repo ! :)

If you like this project and want to fuel its growth, drop a star (I snack on them at night) — your support keeps me going! ♥️
