## Overview

A collection of ComfyUI custom nodes to handle diverse camera projections (pinhole, fisheye, equirectangular), depth‐to‐point cloud conversions, dynamic reprojections, and inpainting/outpainting pipelines. Use these nodes to craft complex VR and 3D‐aware image transformations with minimal setup.

## Features

* ⚡ **Continuous Reprojection**: Transform images and depth maps between projection models.
* 🌐 **Point Cloud Pipelines**: Convert depth to 3D, clean, transform, and reproject point clouds.
* 🎥 **Camera Motion & Outpainting**: Animate camera trajectories, perform text‐guided outpainting in arbitrary views.
* 📦 **Modular Nodes**: Groupable ComfyUI nodes for flexible graph composition.
* 🛠️ **Example Workflows**: Ready‐to‐use JSON workflows demonstrating reprojection, inpainting, and view synthesis.

## Installation

1. **Clone** into your ComfyUI custom nodes folder:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Alexankharin/camera-comfyUI.git custom_nodes/camera-comfyUI
   ```

2. **System Dependencies (Ubuntu)**:

   ```bash
   sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install build-essential ffmpeg libsm6 libxext6 -y
   ```

3. **Python Requirements**:

   ```bash
   pip install -r custom_nodes/camera-comfyUI/requirements.txt
   ```

   * *Optional:* `open3d` for GUI point cloud tools.

4. **Additional Nodes** (for certain workflows):

   * Clone the following repositories directly into your `custom_nodes` folder:

## Trajectory Concept

A **trajectory** in camera-comfyUI is a sequence of camera poses, each represented as a 4×4 transformation matrix. This set of matrices defines the path and orientation of the camera through 3D space, enabling smooth and complex camera movements for view synthesis, point cloud rendering, and video generation.

### Creating Trajectories

There are two main ways to create a trajectory:

- **Camera Matrices Interpolation:**  
  Define two or more camera poses (as matrices), and interpolate between them to generate a smooth path. The `CameraInterpolationNode` automates this process, producing a trajectory tensor for use in camera motion nodes.

- **Walking in Open3D Environment:**  
  Use the interactive Open3D GUI (`CameraTrajectoryNode`) to "walk" through the point cloud. As you move the camera, waypoints (poses) are recorded, forming a trajectory that can be exported and reused.

### Using Trajectories

The `CameraMotionNode` takes a trajectory (set of matrices) and interpolates camera positions and orientations along it, producing smooth camera movements for rendering sequences or videos.

## Point Cloud Formats

Point clouds can be saved and loaded in two formats:

- **.npy**: Numpy array format (fast, preserves all tensor data, recommended for internal pipelines).
- **.ply**: Polygon File Format (widely supported, viewable in external 3D tools).

Use the `SavePointCloud` and `LoadPointCloud` nodes to handle I/O operations in either format.
