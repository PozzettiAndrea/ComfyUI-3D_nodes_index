# TiledAttentionCouple

_TiledAttentionCouple_ is a custom node for ComfyUI that enables _Attention Coupling_ across horizontal or vertical tiles. It allows fine(r)-grained control of prompts across different sections of the image. This is especially useful in scenarios where multiple subjects or themes need to coexist in an image without blending them.

## Configuration

Follow these steps to integrate _Tiled Attention Couple_ into your workflow:

1. Replace positive and negative prompt with _Tiled Attention Couple (Prompt)_.
2. Add _Tiled Attention Couple_. Match `width` and `height` properties to output.
3. Connect _Tiled Attention Couple (Prompt)_ to _Tiled Attention Couple_.
4. Connect _Tiled Attention Couple_ with an input model and clip.
5. Use _Tiled Attention Couple_ output model and conditionings.

For [**Impact Pack**](https://github.com/ltdrdata/ComfyUI-Impact-Pack) integration with _FaceDetailer_, follow these additional steps:

1. Add _Tiled Attention Couple (Impact Pack Detailer)_.
2. Connect _Tiled Attention Couple (Impact Pack Detailer)_ to _FaceDetailer_ `detailer_hook`.
3. Connect _Tiled Attention Couple (Prompt)_ to _Tiled Attention Couple (Impact Pack Detailer)_.
4. Connect _Tiled Attention Couple (Impact Pack Detailer)_ with an input model and clip.

## Usage

_TiledAttentionCouple_ slices the image into horizontal or vertical tiles based on your chosen _division_ and _orientation_. The _division_ is a comma-seperated string representing each tile, where each number represents the relative size of that specific tile:

* `1,1` → two equally-sized tiles.
* `1,2` → two tiles, the second is twice as large as the first.
* `1,1,1` → three equally-sized tiles.

The _orientation_ determines how the tiles are divided: _horizontal_ places tiles side by side (left to right), while _vertical_ stacks them on top of each other (top to bottom):

* `1,2` _horizontal_ → right tile is twice as large as the left tile.
* `1,2` _vertical_ → bottom tile is twice as large as the top tile.

Prompts start with a _common prompt_ that applies to the entire image. After this, you can add _tile prompts_ by separating them with the keyword `BREAK`. Each `BREAK` corresponds to a tile in sequential order, from left to right (for _horizontal_) or top to bottom (for _vertical_).
