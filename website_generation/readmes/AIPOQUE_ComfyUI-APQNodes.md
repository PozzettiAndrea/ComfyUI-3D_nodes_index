# ComfyUI APQNodes

## Introduction
Without fine-tuning, FLUX.1 Dev model cannot understand exact color codes. 
However, it is known that FLUX.1 Dev can repeatedly produce certain colors with certain prompt(color name). 
Fortunately, on CIVITAI, [“novuschroma” shared 155 pre-tested color names](https://civitai.com/models/879997/color-wildcards-for-flux-and-sdxl) that FLUX.1 Dev can handle.
Thanks to his resource, color palette consists exclusively of 155 colors can be configured.
‘ColorPalette’ node from ComfyUI APQNodes converts input hex color code to the most similar color name(from pre-tested 155 color names) of which FLUX.1 Dev is aware.


## Installation
Clone this repo into `custom_nodes` folder.
