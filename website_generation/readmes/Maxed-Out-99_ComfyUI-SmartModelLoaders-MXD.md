# ComfyUI-SmartModelLoaders-MXD

Smart, unified model loaders for ComfyUI that support both standard `.safetensors` and quantized `.gguf` formats — no switching nodes required.

Includes flexible UNET and CLIP loaders that work across models like SDXL, SD3, Flux, and more.

---

## ✅ Features

- 🧠 Unified loaders for `.safetensors` and `.gguf` formats
- 🔀 Drop-in replacements for standard UNET and CLIP nodes
- 💪 Supports single, dual, triple, and quad CLIP configs
- ⚙️ Internal handling of GGUF logic with `GGMLOps` and `GGUFModelPatcher`
- 🧼 Clean fallback to standard ComfyUI loading when needed
