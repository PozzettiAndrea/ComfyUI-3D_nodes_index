# ComfyUI Venice.AI API Custom Nodes

An unofficial custom node implementation for ComfyUI that integrates with venice.ai's Generative AI services such as Image, Text and TTS Generation models (as well as Upscale and Enhance). This project is adapted from [ComfyUI-FLUX-TOGETHER-API](https://github.com/BZcreativ/ComfyUI-FLUX-TOGETHER-API) to work with the venice.ai API.  
**Note**: TTS is in Beta per Venice (as of 15th June 2025). The node for it "Generate Speech (Venice)" is set to BETA/Experimental too. To be able to find it with node search you have to enable "Show experimental nodes in search" setting in ComfyUI.

Disclaimer: I originally made this on a whim because someone wanted something similar to Together.AI custom nodes but have them use venice instead. I'm also not affiliated with Venice.AI. Idk is this good enough for a disclaimer or something

## Nodes: (Text gen node is missing but will be updated soon)

![all nodes showcased](./gh_assets/nodes_showcase.png)  
Image and Text models (as of 15th June 2025 | for Speech gen only tts-kokoro is available)  
For updated text generation experience please use `Generate Text Advanced BETA (Venice)` node and additionally `Textgen Parameters (Venice) for extra venice.ai specific parameters to pass onto the generation process.

~~# todo: inpainting~~  Deprecated by venice, new thing is coming for it at some point

todo: actual log, maybe separate logging file for less clutter from comfyui stuff, maybe, maybe... eeeee

todo: add settings to set default model by user

todo: less convoluted approach to downloading and loading model/character/styles lists

~~todo: LLM characters list~~ done, but its in beta so subject to big changes, use with `Textgen Parameters (Venice)` node

todo: use variants api (currently in beta) | idk what happened to this, probably gone

Todo: chat history/memory/context for LLM | got a vague idea but thats pretty much it

- Some Validation on queue for API limits like prompt max length or width/height
  - these are different for different models so this isnt planned to be implemented unless the api exposes those limits somehow
    - i'd have an error thrown before it gets sent to api about some value being too high or too low (though api should send error back for now either way)
    - maybe the api already exposes those limits, the steps limit is afaik at least, need to look into it

### Below ReadMe text is only slightly altered from original Flux Together API readme, it was not really reworked or anything so its likely not correct or up to date

### Installation - these instructions are a mess

0. Before proceeding, check if you can find these nodes through ComfyUI-Manager interface rather than following the instructions below.

<details><summary>Expand me to see harder instructions</summary>
1. Clone this repository into your ComfyUI custom_nodes directory:

```bash
cd ComfyUI/custom_nodes
git clone https://github.com/DraconicDragon/ComfyUI-Venice-API.git
```

2. Install the required dependencies: (this might be done by comfyui automatically on restart already?)

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

OR From the Comfyui Folder (this one is usually preferred if you have portable edition)

```bash
 ./python_embeded\python.exe -m pip install -r ComfyUI\custom_nodes\ComfyUI-Venice-API\requirements.txt
```

</details>

### Configuration

1. Get your API key from [venice.ai](https://venice.ai)
2. Add your API key in ComfyUI settings > VeniceAI
