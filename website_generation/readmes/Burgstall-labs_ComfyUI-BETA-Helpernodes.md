## Dependencies

*   Requires a standard ComfyUI installation (PyTorch, Torchaudio).
*   **OpenCV:** The `Clip to Sharpest Frame` node requires `opencv-python`. Install it via pip: `pip install opencv-python` (or ensure it's in your environment).
*   **MP3 Saving Requirement:** Saving to `.mp3` requires **FFmpeg** (usually including `libmp3lame`) to be installed on your system and accessible in the system's PATH. WAV and FLAC saving do not require external dependencies beyond torchaudio.
*   **PySceneDetect:** The `Scene detect & split` node requires `scenedetect[opencv]`. Install it via pip: `pip install scenedetect[opencv]` (or ensure it's in your environment).

### Select Sharpest Frames 🔍 🅑🅔🅣🅐

Analyzes frames at regular intervals and selects the sharpest frame from a configurable window around each interval point. Useful for intelligent frame sampling from video sequences.

**Inputs:**

*   `images` (IMAGE): The input batch of images to analyze.
*   `interval` (INT): The interval between frames to analyze (e.g., 5 means analyze every 5th frame).

*   The algorithm handles edge cases where windows extend beyond the batch boundaries.
*   Both selected and rejected frames are output for flexibility in downstream processing.

*   All output dimensions are guaranteed to be multiples of 64 for WAN model compatibility.
*   When source_image is provided, it automatically determines frame_count and overrides the frame_count input.

*   `trigger_word` (STRING): The extracted trigger word from the LoRA filename (text before "_lora").

**Usage Notes:**

*   Set `number_of_loras` to control how many LoRA slots appear in the interface.
*   LoRA filenames like "Snorricam-3434_lora.safetensors" will extract "Snorricam-3434" as the trigger word.
*   If the specified index is out of range or the LoRA fails to load, the original model and clip are returned unchanged.
*   Set any LoRA slot to "none" to skip loading for that position.

### Text line count 🅑🅔🅣🅐

**Inputs:**

*   `text` (STRING): The multiline text to count lines from.

**Outputs:**

*   `line_count` (INT): The total number of lines in the input text.

**Usage Notes:**

*   This node is useful for counting the number of lines in a text input, which can be useful for various text processing tasks.

### Scene detect & split 🎥 🅑🅔🅣🅐

Detects scene changes in a batch of images and outputs up to 5 scenes as individual batches. Remaining frames can be chained to additional Scene detect & split nodes for processing more scenes.

**Inputs:**

*   `images` (IMAGE): The input batch of images (video frames).
*   `threshold` (FLOAT): Detection sensitivity threshold (default: 27.0). Lower values (e.g., 15-20) detect more scene changes (more sensitive). Higher values (e.g., 30-40) detect fewer scene changes (less sensitive).

**Outputs:**

*   `scene_1` through `scene_5` (IMAGE): Individual scene batches. Returns `None` if fewer than N scenes are detected.
*   `remaining_frames` (IMAGE): Frames after the last output scene. Use this to chain to another Scene detect & split node to process more scenes.
*   `scene_frames` (IMAGE): Preview batch containing the start and end frame of each detected scene.
*   `scene_summary` (STRING): Detailed summary including:
    *   Total frames processed
    *   Number of scenes detected vs. output
    *   Number of remaining frames available for chaining
    *   Frame ranges for each output scene
*   `scene_count` (INT): Total number of scenes detected (not limited to 5).

**Usage Notes:**

*   The node detects ALL scenes in the batch but only outputs the first 5 as individual batches.
*   To process more than 5 scenes, chain multiple Scene detect & split nodes:
    1. Connect `remaining_frames` from the first node to `images` input of a second Scene detect & split node
    2. The second node will detect scenes in the remaining frames
    3. Repeat as needed for longer videos
*   The `scene_summary` output provides detailed statistics about what was processed and what's available for chaining.
*   Adjust the `threshold` parameter to fine-tune scene detection sensitivity.

### Video Crop / Stitch Example (Face Analysis / Latent Sync)

This example shows how `Video Crop` and `Video Stitch` can be used in a more complex workflow, such as isolating a face identified by FaceAnalysis, processing it (e.g., with IPAdapter or LatentSync techniques), and then stitching the modified face back into the original video frames.
