I created this custom node because i wasn't getting the results I needed for my usecase when using the [ComfyUI-ToSVG node by Yanick112](https://github.com/Yanick112/ComfyUI-ToSVG) and the [Flux Text to Vector Workflow](https://openart.ai/workflows/odam_ai/flux-text-to-vector-turn-your-images-into-svg-dev-gguf/duJDP3ljuMaWv9cLSkY3) by Stonelax. A big thanks to them for their work and inspiring me to try my own node.

Not getting the results I want is NOT a complaint; 
ComfyUI-toSVG implements the VTracer logic, and this works great for multicolor and detailed images. <br>
For logo's, text, etc. I found [Potrace SVG conversion by Peter Selinger](https://potrace.sourceforge.net/) better suited, with the caveat that it only handles 2 colors; a Foreground and Background. <br>
I also found Potrace optimizes shapes differently, creating fewer vector-points and needing almost to no cleanup when loading the SVG into vector design software.

Potracer to SVG node traces a raster image (IMAGE) into an SVG vector graphic using the ['potracer'](https://github.com/tatarize/potrace) pure Python library for POTRACE by Tatarize. (I may mix up the terms 'potrace' and 'potracer' at times)

## Comparing Vtracer and Potrace

While each user and route will have their specific usecase, my usecase is creating designs for Vinylcutters and logos. This usecase requires sharp images, fluid shapes and clear separation of fore and background. It is also vital to have the lines and curves smooth, with as few vectors as possible while staying true to the form.

| | |
| :-------------: | :-------------: |
| Artifacts | Vector points |
| ![Vtracer vs Potracer Artifacts](img/Vtracer-v-Potracer_artifacts.jpg) | ![Vtracer vs Potracer Vectors](img/Vtracer-v-Potracer_vectors.jpg) |
|*Vtracer (Green, Top) shows significantly more artifacts, hard edges or straight lines, and irregular traces compared to Potracer (Blue, Bottom), which stays true to the original form.*|*Vtracer has significantly more vector points compared to the optimized Potracer version.*|

For usecases where Vtracer suits best, go check out https://github.com/Yanick112/ComfyUI-ToSVG/, where Yanick explains the workings in detail.

In short; As Potrace converts the image to 1 foregroundcolor and 1 backgroundcolor, it is pretty much unusable for any image requiring more than one color, especially photos.

## Installation

Due to both usecases for SVG export are very valid when working with ComfyUI, I opted to keep the naming and category alike for easier navigation.
>***note: This node requires Requires ***LATEST VERSION*** of [Yanick112's ComfyUI-ToSVG](https://github.com/Yanick112/ComfyUI-ToSVG/) --> SaveSVG node to save the SVGfile and VectorToRaster node if you want to reconstruct the SVG to an image if you want to see the result in ComfyUI. See his repository for install instructions***

>***note 2025-05-08: With the new API node a default ComfyUI node SaveSVG is built. This node conflicts with [Yanick112's ComfyUI-ToSVG](https://github.com/Yanick112/ComfyUI-ToSVG/) --> SaveSVG node. The new SaveSVG node is currently under the API nodes, but will eventually be part of base ComfyUI functionality. See this [ComfyUI issue](https://github.com/comfyanonymous/ComfyUI/issues/7980). I have duplicated and renamed Yanick112's SaveSVG node to keep compatibility with older versions. The node now also outputs attaching to the NEW SaveSVG node of ComfyUI v0.3.32 and up.***

  4. Visit <https://github.com/Yanick112/ComfyUI-ToSVG> for installation of ComfyUI-ToSVG

## Intended Usage

The input image should only use 2 distinct colors (e.g. black and white). If other pixel values appear in the input, they will be converted to black and white using a simple threshold method. You can set the Foreground and Background colors for the svg. 

Outputs svg strings as 1 flat shape (as a compound path). Should you want to adjust the shapes by hand, currently, when you release the path in vector design software, the 'internal openings' become filled shapes. This is easy to fix using the boolean tools and substract. My main usecase is Silhouette Studio for vinylcutting and especially with 'zero_sharp_corners' set to true, i don't need to do any postprocessing on the shape.

#### **Workflow details**

The node is model independent, but I'm getting great results using FLux. However, Flux Dev sometimes has trouble with white backgrounds and creates blurry images. Defining a different color background can help a lot with that. Make sure your input image is as clean as possible. Describe your prompt accordingly

Theme: Typography, large bold lettering, playful, dynamic<br>
Text: With the text: "YOUR TEXT"<br>
colors: black, white<br>
Background: Clean white, simple design, no extra details

#### Alternative Route

For the second option in this workflow; you load an existing 2 color image of an icon/text and can convert it to SVG.
You can use an upscale node for the input image, but I found it *rarely* improves quality; in fact, it is usually worse than the original.<br>
It usually helps more to clean up the contrast, especially with highly compressed jpg images.
The output svg can be scaled using the `output_scale` parameter<br><br>

## CHANGENOTES (BREAKING!!!)
- V1.0.0 Initial release
- V1.2.0 BREAKING / FIXING CHANGE: Output LIST --> Output String<br>
  Yanick112's ToSVG Node switched recently from LIST to String. V1.0.0 didn't account for that.<br>
  ComfyUI-ToSVG has the 'nightly' version in ComfyUI Custom Node Manager, and therefor doesn't do versioning.
  -  Update package; in your workflow: rightclick recreate node or Reload example workflow (V1.2).; It should connect now to ToSVG nodes.
  -  If it DID work before and now it doesn't, update the ComfyUI-ToSVG Package.
- V1.3.1 FIXING CHANGE: SaveSVG
  With the new API node a default ComfyUI node SaveSVG is built. This node conflicts with [Yanick112's ComfyUI-ToSVG](https://github.com/Yanick112/ComfyUI-ToSVG/) --> SaveSVG node. The new SaveSVG node is currently under the API nodes, but will eventually be part of base ComfyUI functionality. See this [ComfyUI issue](https://github.com/comfyanonymous/ComfyUI/issues/7980). I have duplicated and renamed Yanick112's SaveSVG node to keep compatibility with older versions. The node now also outputs attaching to the NEW SaveSVG node of ComfyUI v0.3.32 and up.   


## To Do

- [X] Deploy V1 to Github
- [X] Deploy to Comfyregistry
- [X] Add Output Scale factor (v1.1)
- [ ] Real life testing & feedback

## Disclaimer

This is my First ever (public) ComfyUI node.
While tested thoroughly, and as with all custom nodes, **USE AT YOUR OWN RISK**.

While tested a lot and I have IT knowledge, I am no programmer by trade. This is a passion project for my own specific usecase and I'm sharing it so other people might benefit from it just as much as i benefitted from others. I am convinced this implementation has its flaws and it will probably not work on all other installations worldwide.
I can not guarantee if this project will get more updates and when.
