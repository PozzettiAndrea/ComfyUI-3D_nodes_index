### ReduxFineTune

The **ReduxFineTune** node provides a simple and user-friendly tool for style fusion, requiring only the core parameters to efficiently blend text and image features. It features a precise fusion strength slider (0.1-2.0) for fine control over the style intensity. This node is ideal for most standard style fine-tuning scenarios.

### ReduxFineTuneAdvanced
The **ReduxFineTuneAdvanced** node is designed for advanced users, offering support for cropping, masking, region-wise fusion, and fine-grained control over various style strengths and details. This node is suitable for scenarios that demand higher customization and control over style transfer.

Both nodes support all unified fusion modes and can enable the SUPER REDUX enhancement mode, making them suitable for everything from quick results to highly detailed style control.

**Function:**
Fine-tune style by fusing text and image features with multiple blend modes and strengths.

## Fusion Modes (Blend Modes)

All fusion modes (blend modes) are now globally unified in the codebase. Both the advanced and simple nodes use the same set of fusion modes, and their behavior is guaranteed to be consistent.

**Available Fusion Modes:**
| Fusion Mode    | Description                                                                                                                         |
|----------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Mix**            | Linear blend. Mainly uses the reference image. Suitable for style transfer and light style fusion.                                  |
| **Enhance**        | Feature enhancement. Improves details and realism. Suitable for stronger style influence.                                           |
| **Sharpen**        | Frequency enhancement. Highlights high-frequency details, making the image sharper.                                                 |
| **AdaIN**          | Adaptive Instance Normalization. Automatically matches the mean and variance of style and content features. Suitable for style transfer. |
| **Residual**       | Residual blend. Fuses the difference between style and content. Suitable for balancing both.                                        |
| **Max**            | Element-wise maximum. Keeps the stronger part of style and content features. Suitable for highlighting prominent features.          |
| **Min**            | Element-wise minimum. Keeps the weaker part of style and content features. Suitable for soft fusion.                                |
| **Random**         | Random blend. Randomly selects style or content features. Suitable for generating diverse effects.                                  |
| **FrequencyMix**   | Frequency domain blend. Low frequency from image, high frequency from text. Suitable for structure and detail separation fusion.    |

**How to extend:**
To add or modify a fusion mode, simply update the `FUSION_MODES` list and the `fuse_features` function in the code. All nodes will automatically use the new or updated mode.
