Some practical ComfyUI image/mask process nodes make you earn some real money! (Yuan means chinese currency).


UPDATE

v1.0.1
add a mask preprocess node by morpholog：Mask Preprocess Morphology,
Fixed the issue with the processing of masks in this project (https://github.com/BadCafeCode/masquerade-nodes-comfyui), which would have caused the mask to be output in image format and not be used directly in subsequent generation processes

v1.0.0
add a node which allows load random image(s) form Local directory.
