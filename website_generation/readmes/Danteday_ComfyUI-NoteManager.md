    * Enter your note in the modal window and click "Save". 
2.  **View notes on a node**:
    * Right-click on a node with notes and select "📑 View Notes (`N`)" from the context menu (where `N` is the note count). 
3.  **Edit or delete notes**:
    * In the notes modal, use the ✏️ button to edit a note. 
    * Use the 🗑️ button to delete a note. 
4.  **Identify nodes with notes**:
    * Nodes with notes display an orange circle with the number of notes above the title (when not collapsed).

## Tips and Tricks
-   **Updating notes**: When adding or editing notes, or when you open a new workflow tab, you need to refresh the manager using the 🔄 button next to the note search field; otherwise, you may experience a synchronization issue.
-   **Workflow Documentation**: Use notes on key nodes (like Loaders, Checkpoints, Samplers) to explain their role or settings. 
-   **Parameter Tracking**: Note down specific seeds, CFG scales, or prompt keywords that produced interesting results.
-   **Troubleshooting**: Document errors encountered or specific settings needed to make a custom node work correctly.
-   **Idea Repository**: Jot down ideas for workflow improvements or variations directly on the relevant nodes.
-   **Global Overview**: Use the global panel to quickly review all annotations in a complex workflow.

Here are the 5 options:
-   🔴 Node selection required – You must manually select the node to which the note should be added.
-   🟡 Title match – Matches the node's name, but not its ID.
-   🟡 ID match – Use this if you renamed the node to which you want to attach the note and are absolutely sure of your actions.
-   🟢 Full match (ID and title) – The best option for loading; it ensures a 100% match.
-   ⚪ Selected manually – The node is selected manually.
